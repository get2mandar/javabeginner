# Java Applications 
**By Mandar Pandit**

This is very basic Repository I created when I started with the Blog, for Best Of Hello World.
Initially I was not much aware about using git, so I have created multiple projects under the same repository.

This Repository contains below Projects:
 - ebs-spring-hibernate
 - power-mockito-app
 - spring-mvn
 - tiles-example

<br>

### ebs-spring-hibernate
This Application is basically Sample for using the Spring-Hibernate Combination.

### power-mockito-app
This Application is simple example for using Power Mockito with JUnit for Unit testing.

### spring-mvn
My first example for SPring MVN.

### tiles-example
This is sample Application for Apache Struts Tiles.
